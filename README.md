A classic Snake Game built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Control the snake using arrow keys to eat food, grow longer, and increase your score. The game ends when the snake hits the walls or its own body. Simple yet addictive, this web-based game is a great introduction to basic game development.
